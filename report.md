## Theoretical concepts

A protein is flexible if it can adapt to different environments or ligands (binding events requires flexibility). Therefore, flexibility and adaptability are synonymous[^fn1].

Additionally, an inverse relationship between protein stability and the biological function of both enzymes and protein hormones has been described, underscoring the fact that function necessitates flexibility.
